### <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/320/apple/354/books_1f4da.png" width="16px"> *Background*

Before I became a developer I was a molecular biologist studying how proteins control gene expression. As a molecular biologist most of my time was spent in the lab working directly with DNA, RNA, and proteins. But often I would bump into a problem that needed some custom software. As I learned to develop these small-personal programs, I became more and more drawn to programming and would want to spend the whole day playing around with code. Eventually I decided to make the switch and develop full time. I'm motivated to build tools that will benefit others.

 * Curiosity
    * My biggest strength is my curiosity and I often leverage it to motivate my work and exploration.
 * Ambition
    * I have always been a self-starter. As long as I can keep my motivations straight, I can work independantly for months or years without outside validation.
 * Accountability
    * I like to live life as a minimalist with the few things I do possess being highly valued. Accountability is one of those traits/possessions that I won't life without. I am honest and dependable when I commit to a task.

I'm deadset on building a better life for myself and my dependents. I want the skills I accrue to build one on top of the other so that I can build better tools and make a difference.

### <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/320/apple/354/person-climbing_1f9d7.png" width="16px"> *Hobbies and Interests*

I am an avid rock climber, mechanical tinkerer, and hobby historian. I try to stay fit to help my mental health and to climb beautiful rocks. I enjoy learning about mechanical devices, everything from industrial machines to space craft. I love learning about history through the lens of the people that experienced and shaped it. It's always a good day if I manage to lay one more mystery to rest!

Fun fact I learned yesterday, the combustion chamber for the Space Shuttle was fabricated with the help of wax!
