### <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/320/apple/354/books_1f4da.png" width="16px"> *Background*

Before I became a developer I was a molecular biologist studying how proteins control gene expression. As a molecular biologist, most of my time was spent in the lab working directly with DNA, RNA, and proteins. But often I would bump into a problem that needed some custom software. As I learned to develop these small-personal programs, I became more and more drawn to programming and would want to spend the whole day playing around with code. Eventually I decided to make the switch and develop full time. I want to build tools that will benefit people; just like the tools that I relied on everyday in the lab.

I'm deadset on building a better life for myself and my dependents. I want the skills I accrue to build one on top of the other so that I can go further and build better tools.

I have gotten comfortable using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React to build websites; at least for the basics. My next focus is to learn how to build and manage a server/database.

### <img src="https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/320/apple/354/person-climbing_1f9d7.png" width="16px"> *Hobbies and Interests*

I am an avid rock climber and hobby historian; that loves piecing the world together one puzzle piece at a time. I enjoy learning about mechanic devices, everything from industrial machines to space craft. I love learning about history through the lens of the people that experienced and shaped it. It's always a good day if I manage to lay one more mystery to rest!
